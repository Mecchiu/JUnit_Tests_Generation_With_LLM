     * * Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
     * The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.
     *
     * Example:
     * willItFly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False
     * # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.
     *
     * willItFly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
     * # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.
     *
     * willItFly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
     * # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
     *
     * willItFly([3], 5) ➞ True
     * # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.
