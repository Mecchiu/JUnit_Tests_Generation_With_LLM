/**
 * {@code GroupLayoutEngineer} is a shell for the layout manager
 * {@code GroupLayout}. It allows to control components' placement
 * using simple 2-dimensional textual schemes.
 * <p>
 * Such approach to GUI creation removes the problem
 * of representing a 2-dimensional GUI by 1-dimensional code.
 *
 * <h3>How to use the {@code GroupLayoutEngineer}</h3>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> Create an instance of the {@code GroupLayoutEngineer}.
 * The first parameter of the constructor is a reference to the container,
 * and the rest are the lines of the textual scheme. For example:
 * <pre>
 * GroupLayoutEngineer gle = new GroupLayoutEngineer(
 *    getContentPane(),
 * 	""FINDLABEL  TEXTFIELD      FINDBUTTON  "",
 * 	""          --------------+             "",
 * 	""           CB11   CB12  | CANSELBUTTON"",
 * 	""                        |             "",
 * 	""           CB21   CB22  |             "");
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li> Associate the names on the scheme with concrete components, for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.associate(""FINDLABEL"", new JLabel(""Find What:""));
 * gle.associate(""TEXTFIELD"", new JTextField());
 * gle.associate(""FINDBUTTON"", new JButton(""Find""));
 * gle.associate(""CB11"", new JCheckBox(""Match Case""));
 * gle.associate(""CB12"", new JCheckBox(""Wrap Around""));
 * gle.associate(""CB21"", new JCheckBox(""Whole Words""));
 * gle.associate(""CB22"", new JCheckBox(""Search Backwards""));
 * gle.associate(""CANSELBUTTON"", new JButton(""Cancel""));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li> Apply optional preferences (such as special alignment), for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.linkSize(""FINDBUTTON"", ""CANSELBUTTON"");
 *
 * gle.getParallelGroup(Axis.VERTICAL, ""FINDLABEL"",""FINDBUTTON"")
 * 	.setContentAlignment(Alignment.BASELINE);
 *
 * gle.setAutoCreateGaps(true);
 * gle.setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true);
 * </pre>
 * Note that the alignment in the group above
 * could also be automatically set to {@code Baseline}
 * by calling the method {@code setAutoAlignJTextFields()}.
 * <p><br>
 *
 * <li> Invoke the method
 * <pre>
 * gle.engineer();
 * </pre>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>How to control gaps</h3>
 *
 * If you wish to control the gaps yourself instead of relying
 * on automatic gaps creation, you will have two choices.
 * <p>
 * We recommend to deal with gaps like with components, i.e.,
 * to place the required gaps at the scheme
 * and then to associate them with concrete parameters (types and lengthes),
 * for example:
 * <pre>
 * GroupLayoutEngineer gle = new GroupLayoutEngineer(
 *    getContentPane(),
 * 	""FINDLABEL .. TEXTFIELD      . FINDBUTTON  "",
 * 	""            --------------+       .       "",
 * 	""             CB11 .g CB12 |   CANSELBUTTON"",
 * 	""               .          |               "",
 * 	""             CB21    CB22 |               "");
 *
 * gle.associateGap(""."", ComponentPlacement.RELATED);
 * gle.associateGap("".."", ComponentPlacement.UNRELATED);
 * gle.associateGap("".g1"", 20);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that each gap on the scheme must be started from a dot
 * (in order to make it looking different from components).
 * <p>
 * Also note that any gap (associated with the required parameters)
 * may appear on the scheme any number of times,
 * unlike the components, which appear on the scheme only once.
 * <p>
 * Note that you may skip the associations of the denotations ""."" and ""..""
 * with related and unrelated gaps respectively,
 * because these associations are always applied by default.
 *
 * <p><br>
 * Alternatively, you may add gaps to the layout
 * without making additional changes to the scheme.
 * This approach requires specifying concrete sequential or parallel groups
 * and their concrete elements near which a gap should be added, for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.getSequentialGroup(Axis.HORIZONTAL, ""CB11"", ""CB22"")
 *   .getGroup(""CB12"",""CB22"")
 *     .addPrecedingUnrelatedGap(GroupLayout.DEFAULT_SIZE,Short.MAX_VALUE);
 * </pre>
 * We do not recommend to use the letter approach because it minimizes
 * the advantages of the group layout engineer.
 *
 * <h3>How to draw schemes</h3>
 *
 * In order to avoid formal introduction to this topic,
 * we refer to the examples in the package {@code glengineer.demos}
 * for general introduction to the schemes.
 * <p>
 * Here we mention specific yet essential details only.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> The names of components (and gaps) on the scheme may consist of
 * letters of any case, numbers, and underscores '_'.
 * <li> For each layout direction (horizontal and vertical)
 * the engineer tries to divide every non-trivial block of elements
 * on the scheme into a sequential or a parallel
 * (if the former is not possible) group of elements or subblocks.
 * <li> One may place on the scheme horizontal and vertical lines
 * which consist of symbols '-' and '|' respectively
 * (and optionally of symbols '+' for the intersections).
 * <li> If a block on the scheme is intersected by
 * a (horizontal or vertical) line, then this block will
 * not be divided into a sequential group of that direction.
 * Hence, it will be divided into a parallel group.
 * <li> The lines do not influence the layout in the perpendicular direction
 * (but, certainly, this layout direction is influenced
 * by the space under the line).
 * <li> If a block is divided into a parallel group by a number of lines,
 * it is divided only by those of them which have the maximum length,
 * and the smaller lines (if they exist) are left for the subblocks.
 * <li> Gaps on the scheme affect sequential groups only.
 * <li> If two sequential subblocks are divided by a number of gaps,
 * then these gaps will be replaced by a single gap of that type.
 * <li> Gaps on the scheme may lie AT lines.
 * Such lines are considered as being continued under that gaps,
 * and the gaps affect only the direction perpendicular to the
 * corresponding line.
 * <li> A line may be intersected only by one gap.
 * <li> If a gap touches one of the sides of a line,
 * it is also assumed that they intersect.
 * </ol>

/**
 * {@code GroupLayoutEngineer} is a shell for the layout manager
 * {@code GroupLayout}. It allows to control components' placement
 * using simple 2-dimensional textual schemes.
 * <p>
 * Such approach to GUI creation removes the problem
 * of representing a 2-dimensional GUI by 1-dimensional code.
 *
 * <h3>How to use the {@code GroupLayoutEngineer}</h3>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> Create an instance of the {@code GroupLayoutEngineer}.
 * The first parameter of the constructor is a reference to the container,
 * and the rest are the lines of the textual scheme. For example:
 * <pre>
 * GroupLayoutEngineer gle = new GroupLayoutEngineer(
 *    getContentPane(),
 * 	""FINDLABEL  TEXTFIELD      FINDBUTTON  "",
 * 	""          --------------+             "",
 * 	""           CB11   CB12  | CANSELBUTTON"",
 * 	""                        |             "",
 * 	""           CB21   CB22  |             "");
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li> Associate the names on the scheme with concrete components, for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.associate(""FINDLABEL"", new JLabel(""Find What:""));
 * gle.associate(""TEXTFIELD"", new JTextField());
 * gle.associate(""FINDBUTTON"", new JButton(""Find""));
 * gle.associate(""CB11"", new JCheckBox(""Match Case""));
 * gle.associate(""CB12"", new JCheckBox(""Wrap Around""));
 * gle.associate(""CB21"", new JCheckBox(""Whole Words""));
 * gle.associate(""CB22"", new JCheckBox(""Search Backwards""));
 * gle.associate(""CANSELBUTTON"", new JButton(""Cancel""));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li> Apply optional preferences (such as special alignment), for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.linkSize(""FINDBUTTON"", ""CANSELBUTTON"");
 *
 * gle.getParallelGroup(Axis.VERTICAL, ""FINDLABEL"",""FINDBUTTON"")
 * 	.setContentAlignment(Alignment.BASELINE);
 *
 * gle.setAutoCreateGaps(true);
 * gle.setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true);
 * </pre>
 * Note that the alignment in the group above
 * could also be automatically set to {@code Baseline}
 * by calling the method {@code setAutoAlignJTextFields()}.
 * <p><br>
 *
 * <li> Invoke the method
 * <pre>
 * gle.engineer();
 * </pre>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>How to control gaps</h3>
 *
 * If you wish to control the gaps yourself instead of relying
 * on automatic gaps creation, you will have two choices.
 * <p>
 * We recommend to deal with gaps like with components, i.e.,
 * to place the required gaps at the scheme
 * and then to associate them with concrete parameters (types and lengthes),
 * for example:
 * <pre>
 * GroupLayoutEngineer gle = new GroupLayoutEngineer(
 *    getContentPane(),
 * 	""FINDLABEL .. TEXTFIELD      . FINDBUTTON  "",
 * 	""            --------------+       .       "",
 * 	""             CB11 .g CB12 |   CANSELBUTTON"",
 * 	""               .          |               "",
 * 	""             CB21    CB22 |               "");
 *
 * gle.associateGap(""."", ComponentPlacement.RELATED);
 * gle.associateGap("".."", ComponentPlacement.UNRELATED);
 * gle.associateGap("".g1"", 20);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that each gap on the scheme must be started from a dot
 * (in order to make it looking different from components).
 * <p>
 * Also note that any gap (associated with the required parameters)
 * may appear on the scheme any number of times,
 * unlike the components, which appear on the scheme only once.
 * <p>
 * Note that you may skip the associations of the denotations ""."" and ""..""
 * with related and unrelated gaps respectively,
 * because these associations are always applied by default.
 *
 * <p><br>
 * Alternatively, you may add gaps to the layout
 * without making additional changes to the scheme.
 * This approach requires specifying concrete sequential or parallel groups
 * and their concrete elements near which a gap should be added, for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.getSequentialGroup(Axis.HORIZONTAL, ""CB11"", ""CB22"")
 *   .getGroup(""CB12"",""CB22"")
 *     .addPrecedingUnrelatedGap(GroupLayout.DEFAULT_SIZE,Short.MAX_VALUE);
 * </pre>
 * We do not recommend to use the letter approach because it minimizes
 * the advantages of the group layout engineer.
 *
 * <h3>How to draw schemes</h3>
 *
 * In order to avoid formal introduction to this topic,
 * we refer to the examples in the package {@code glengineer.demos}
 * for general introduction to the schemes.
 * <p>
 * Here we mention specific yet essential details only.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> The names of components (and gaps) on the scheme may consist of
 * letters of any case, numbers, and underscores '_'.
 * <li> For each layout direction (horizontal and vertical)
 * the engineer tries to divide every non-trivial block of elements
 * on the scheme into a sequential or a parallel
 * (if the former is not possible) group of elements or subblocks.
 * <li> One may place on the scheme horizontal and vertical lines
 * which consist of symbols '-' and '|' respectively
 * (and optionally of symbols '+' for the intersections).
 * <li> If a block on the scheme is intersected by
 * a (horizontal or vertical) line, then this block will
 * not be divided into a sequential group of that direction.
 * Hence, it will be divided into a parallel group.
 * <li> The lines do not influence the layout in the perpendicular direction
 * (but, certainly, this layout direction is influenced
 * by the space under the line).
 * <li> If a block is divided into a parallel group by a number of lines,
 * it is divided only by those of them which have the maximum length,
 * and the smaller lines (if they exist) are left for the subblocks.
 * <li> Gaps on the scheme affect sequential groups only.
 * <li> If two sequential subblocks are divided by a number of gaps,
 * then these gaps will be replaced by a single gap of that type.
 * <li> Gaps on the scheme may lie AT lines.
 * Such lines are considered as being continued under that gaps,
 * and the gaps affect only the direction perpendicular to the
 * corresponding line.
 * <li> A line may be intersected only by one gap.
 * <li> If a gap touches one of the sides of a line,
 * it is also assumed that they intersect.
 * </ol>

/**
 * {@code GroupLayoutEngineer} is a shell for the layout manager
 * {@code GroupLayout}. It allows to control components' placement
 * using simple 2-dimensional textual schemes.
 * <p>
 * Such approach to GUI creation removes the problem
 * of representing a 2-dimensional GUI by 1-dimensional code.
 *
 * <h3>How to use the {@code GroupLayoutEngineer}</h3>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> Create an instance of the {@code GroupLayoutEngineer}.
 * The first parameter of the constructor is a reference to the container,
 * and the rest are the lines of the textual scheme. For example:
 * <pre>
 * GroupLayoutEngineer gle = new GroupLayoutEngineer(
 *    getContentPane(),
 * 	""FINDLABEL  TEXTFIELD      FINDBUTTON  "",
 * 	""          --------------+             "",
 * 	""           CB11   CB12  | CANSELBUTTON"",
 * 	""                        |             "",
 * 	""           CB21   CB22  |             "");
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li> Associate the names on the scheme with concrete components, for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.associate(""FINDLABEL"", new JLabel(""Find What:""));
 * gle.associate(""TEXTFIELD"", new JTextField());
 * gle.associate(""FINDBUTTON"", new JButton(""Find""));
 * gle.associate(""CB11"", new JCheckBox(""Match Case""));
 * gle.associate(""CB12"", new JCheckBox(""Wrap Around""));
 * gle.associate(""CB21"", new JCheckBox(""Whole Words""));
 * gle.associate(""CB22"", new JCheckBox(""Search Backwards""));
 * gle.associate(""CANSELBUTTON"", new JButton(""Cancel""));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li> Apply optional preferences (such as special alignment), for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.linkSize(""FINDBUTTON"", ""CANSELBUTTON"");
 *
 * gle.getParallelGroup(Axis.VERTICAL, ""FINDLABEL"",""FINDBUTTON"")
 * 	.setContentAlignment(Alignment.BASELINE);
 *
 * gle.setAutoCreateGaps(true);
 * gle.setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true);
 * </pre>
 * Note that the alignment in the group above
 * could also be automatically set to {@code Baseline}
 * by calling the method {@code setAutoAlignJTextFields()}.
 * <p><br>
 *
 * <li> Invoke the method
 * <pre>
 * gle.engineer();
 * </pre>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>How to control gaps</h3>
 *
 * If you wish to control the gaps yourself instead of relying
 * on automatic gaps creation, you will have two choices.
 * <p>
 * We recommend to deal with gaps like with components, i.e.,
 * to place the required gaps at the scheme
 * and then to associate them with concrete parameters (types and lengthes),
 * for example:
 * <pre>
 * GroupLayoutEngineer gle = new GroupLayoutEngineer(
 *    getContentPane(),
 * 	""FINDLABEL .. TEXTFIELD      . FINDBUTTON  "",
 * 	""            --------------+       .       "",
 * 	""             CB11 .g CB12 |   CANSELBUTTON"",
 * 	""               .          |               "",
 * 	""             CB21    CB22 |               "");
 *
 * gle.associateGap(""."", ComponentPlacement.RELATED);
 * gle.associateGap("".."", ComponentPlacement.UNRELATED);
 * gle.associateGap("".g1"", 20);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that each gap on the scheme must be started from a dot
 * (in order to make it looking different from components).
 * <p>
 * Also note that any gap (associated with the required parameters)
 * may appear on the scheme any number of times,
 * unlike the components, which appear on the scheme only once.
 * <p>
 * Note that you may skip the associations of the denotations ""."" and ""..""
 * with related and unrelated gaps respectively,
 * because these associations are always applied by default.
 *
 * <p><br>
 * Alternatively, you may add gaps to the layout
 * without making additional changes to the scheme.
 * This approach requires specifying concrete sequential or parallel groups
 * and their concrete elements near which a gap should be added, for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.getSequentialGroup(Axis.HORIZONTAL, ""CB11"", ""CB22"")
 *   .getGroup(""CB12"",""CB22"")
 *     .addPrecedingUnrelatedGap(GroupLayout.DEFAULT_SIZE,Short.MAX_VALUE);
 * </pre>
 * We do not recommend to use the letter approach because it minimizes
 * the advantages of the group layout engineer.
 *
 * <h3>How to draw schemes</h3>
 *
 * In order to avoid formal introduction to this topic,
 * we refer to the examples in the package {@code glengineer.demos}
 * for general introduction to the schemes.
 * <p>
 * Here we mention specific yet essential details only.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> The names of components (and gaps) on the scheme may consist of
 * letters of any case, numbers, and underscores '_'.
 * <li> For each layout direction (horizontal and vertical)
 * the engineer tries to divide every non-trivial block of elements
 * on the scheme into a sequential or a parallel
 * (if the former is not possible) group of elements or subblocks.
 * <li> One may place on the scheme horizontal and vertical lines
 * which consist of symbols '-' and '|' respectively
 * (and optionally of symbols '+' for the intersections).
 * <li> If a block on the scheme is intersected by
 * a (horizontal or vertical) line, then this block will
 * not be divided into a sequential group of that direction.
 * Hence, it will be divided into a parallel group.
 * <li> The lines do not influence the layout in the perpendicular direction
 * (but, certainly, this layout direction is influenced
 * by the space under the line).
 * <li> If a block is divided into a parallel group by a number of lines,
 * it is divided only by those of them which have the maximum length,
 * and the smaller lines (if they exist) are left for the subblocks.
 * <li> Gaps on the scheme affect sequential groups only.
 * <li> If two sequential subblocks are divided by a number of gaps,
 * then these gaps will be replaced by a single gap of that type.
 * <li> Gaps on the scheme may lie AT lines.
 * Such lines are considered as being continued under that gaps,
 * and the gaps affect only the direction perpendicular to the
 * corresponding line.
 * <li> A line may be intersected only by one gap.
 * <li> If a gap touches one of the sides of a line,
 * it is also assumed that they intersect.
 * </ol>

/**
 * {@code GroupLayoutEngineer} is a shell for the layout manager
 * {@code GroupLayout}. It allows to control components' placement
 * using simple 2-dimensional textual schemes.
 * <p>
 * Such approach to GUI creation removes the problem
 * of representing a 2-dimensional GUI by 1-dimensional code.
 *
 * <h3>How to use the {@code GroupLayoutEngineer}</h3>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> Create an instance of the {@code GroupLayoutEngineer}.
 * The first parameter of the constructor is a reference to the container,
 * and the rest are the lines of the textual scheme. For example:
 * <pre>
 * GroupLayoutEngineer gle = new GroupLayoutEngineer(
 *    getContentPane(),
 * 	""FINDLABEL  TEXTFIELD      FINDBUTTON  "",
 * 	""          --------------+             "",
 * 	""           CB11   CB12  | CANSELBUTTON"",
 * 	""                        |             "",
 * 	""           CB21   CB22  |             "");
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li> Associate the names on the scheme with concrete components, for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.associate(""FINDLABEL"", new JLabel(""Find What:""));
 * gle.associate(""TEXTFIELD"", new JTextField());
 * gle.associate(""FINDBUTTON"", new JButton(""Find""));
 * gle.associate(""CB11"", new JCheckBox(""Match Case""));
 * gle.associate(""CB12"", new JCheckBox(""Wrap Around""));
 * gle.associate(""CB21"", new JCheckBox(""Whole Words""));
 * gle.associate(""CB22"", new JCheckBox(""Search Backwards""));
 * gle.associate(""CANSELBUTTON"", new JButton(""Cancel""));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li> Apply optional preferences (such as special alignment), for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.linkSize(""FINDBUTTON"", ""CANSELBUTTON"");
 *
 * gle.getParallelGroup(Axis.VERTICAL, ""FINDLABEL"",""FINDBUTTON"")
 * 	.setContentAlignment(Alignment.BASELINE);
 *
 * gle.setAutoCreateGaps(true);
 * gle.setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true);
 * </pre>
 * Note that the alignment in the group above
 * could also be automatically set to {@code Baseline}
 * by calling the method {@code setAutoAlignJTextFields()}.
 * <p><br>
 *
 * <li> Invoke the method
 * <pre>
 * gle.engineer();
 * </pre>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>How to control gaps</h3>
 *
 * If you wish to control the gaps yourself instead of relying
 * on automatic gaps creation, you will have two choices.
 * <p>
 * We recommend to deal with gaps like with components, i.e.,
 * to place the required gaps at the scheme
 * and then to associate them with concrete parameters (types and lengthes),
 * for example:
 * <pre>
 * GroupLayoutEngineer gle = new GroupLayoutEngineer(
 *    getContentPane(),
 * 	""FINDLABEL .. TEXTFIELD      . FINDBUTTON  "",
 * 	""            --------------+       .       "",
 * 	""             CB11 .g CB12 |   CANSELBUTTON"",
 * 	""               .          |               "",
 * 	""             CB21    CB22 |               "");
 *
 * gle.associateGap(""."", ComponentPlacement.RELATED);
 * gle.associateGap("".."", ComponentPlacement.UNRELATED);
 * gle.associateGap("".g1"", 20);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that each gap on the scheme must be started from a dot
 * (in order to make it looking different from components).
 * <p>
 * Also note that any gap (associated with the required parameters)
 * may appear on the scheme any number of times,
 * unlike the components, which appear on the scheme only once.
 * <p>
 * Note that you may skip the associations of the denotations ""."" and ""..""
 * with related and unrelated gaps respectively,
 * because these associations are always applied by default.
 *
 * <p><br>
 * Alternatively, you may add gaps to the layout
 * without making additional changes to the scheme.
 * This approach requires specifying concrete sequential or parallel groups
 * and their concrete elements near which a gap should be added, for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.getSequentialGroup(Axis.HORIZONTAL, ""CB11"", ""CB22"")
 *   .getGroup(""CB12"",""CB22"")
 *     .addPrecedingUnrelatedGap(GroupLayout.DEFAULT_SIZE,Short.MAX_VALUE);
 * </pre>
 * We do not recommend to use the letter approach because it minimizes
 * the advantages of the group layout engineer.
 *
 * <h3>How to draw schemes</h3>
 *
 * In order to avoid formal introduction to this topic,
 * we refer to the examples in the package {@code glengineer.demos}
 * for general introduction to the schemes.
 * <p>
 * Here we mention specific yet essential details only.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> The names of components (and gaps) on the scheme may consist of
 * letters of any case, numbers, and underscores '_'.
 * <li> For each layout direction (horizontal and vertical)
 * the engineer tries to divide every non-trivial block of elements
 * on the scheme into a sequential or a parallel
 * (if the former is not possible) group of elements or subblocks.
 * <li> One may place on the scheme horizontal and vertical lines
 * which consist of symbols '-' and '|' respectively
 * (and optionally of symbols '+' for the intersections).
 * <li> If a block on the scheme is intersected by
 * a (horizontal or vertical) line, then this block will
 * not be divided into a sequential group of that direction.
 * Hence, it will be divided into a parallel group.
 * <li> The lines do not influence the layout in the perpendicular direction
 * (but, certainly, this layout direction is influenced
 * by the space under the line).
 * <li> If a block is divided into a parallel group by a number of lines,
 * it is divided only by those of them which have the maximum length,
 * and the smaller lines (if they exist) are left for the subblocks.
 * <li> Gaps on the scheme affect sequential groups only.
 * <li> If two sequential subblocks are divided by a number of gaps,
 * then these gaps will be replaced by a single gap of that type.
 * <li> Gaps on the scheme may lie AT lines.
 * Such lines are considered as being continued under that gaps,
 * and the gaps affect only the direction perpendicular to the
 * corresponding line.
 * <li> A line may be intersected only by one gap.
 * <li> If a gap touches one of the sides of a line,
 * it is also assumed that they intersect.
 * </ol>

/**
 * {@code GroupLayoutEngineer} is a shell for the layout manager
 * {@code GroupLayout}. It allows to control components' placement
 * using simple 2-dimensional textual schemes.
 * <p>
 * Such approach to GUI creation removes the problem
 * of representing a 2-dimensional GUI by 1-dimensional code.
 *
 * <h3>How to use the {@code GroupLayoutEngineer}</h3>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> Create an instance of the {@code GroupLayoutEngineer}.
 * The first parameter of the constructor is a reference to the container,
 * and the rest are the lines of the textual scheme. For example:
 * <pre>
 * GroupLayoutEngineer gle = new GroupLayoutEngineer(
 *    getContentPane(),
 * 	""FINDLABEL  TEXTFIELD      FINDBUTTON  "",
 * 	""          --------------+             "",
 * 	""           CB11   CB12  | CANSELBUTTON"",
 * 	""                        |             "",
 * 	""           CB21   CB22  |             "");
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li> Associate the names on the scheme with concrete components, for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.associate(""FINDLABEL"", new JLabel(""Find What:""));
 * gle.associate(""TEXTFIELD"", new JTextField());
 * gle.associate(""FINDBUTTON"", new JButton(""Find""));
 * gle.associate(""CB11"", new JCheckBox(""Match Case""));
 * gle.associate(""CB12"", new JCheckBox(""Wrap Around""));
 * gle.associate(""CB21"", new JCheckBox(""Whole Words""));
 * gle.associate(""CB22"", new JCheckBox(""Search Backwards""));
 * gle.associate(""CANSELBUTTON"", new JButton(""Cancel""));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li> Apply optional preferences (such as special alignment), for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.linkSize(""FINDBUTTON"", ""CANSELBUTTON"");
 *
 * gle.getParallelGroup(Axis.VERTICAL, ""FINDLABEL"",""FINDBUTTON"")
 * 	.setContentAlignment(Alignment.BASELINE);
 *
 * gle.setAutoCreateGaps(true);
 * gle.setAutoCreateContainerGaps(true);
 * </pre>
 * Note that the alignment in the group above
 * could also be automatically set to {@code Baseline}
 * by calling the method {@code setAutoAlignJTextFields()}.
 * <p><br>
 *
 * <li> Invoke the method
 * <pre>
 * gle.engineer();
 * </pre>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>How to control gaps</h3>
 *
 * If you wish to control the gaps yourself instead of relying
 * on automatic gaps creation, you will have two choices.
 * <p>
 * We recommend to deal with gaps like with components, i.e.,
 * to place the required gaps at the scheme
 * and then to associate them with concrete parameters (types and lengthes),
 * for example:
 * <pre>
 * GroupLayoutEngineer gle = new GroupLayoutEngineer(
 *    getContentPane(),
 * 	""FINDLABEL .. TEXTFIELD      . FINDBUTTON  "",
 * 	""            --------------+       .       "",
 * 	""             CB11 .g CB12 |   CANSELBUTTON"",
 * 	""               .          |               "",
 * 	""             CB21    CB22 |               "");
 *
 * gle.associateGap(""."", ComponentPlacement.RELATED);
 * gle.associateGap("".."", ComponentPlacement.UNRELATED);
 * gle.associateGap("".g1"", 20);
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that each gap on the scheme must be started from a dot
 * (in order to make it looking different from components).
 * <p>
 * Also note that any gap (associated with the required parameters)
 * may appear on the scheme any number of times,
 * unlike the components, which appear on the scheme only once.
 * <p>
 * Note that you may skip the associations of the denotations ""."" and ""..""
 * with related and unrelated gaps respectively,
 * because these associations are always applied by default.
 *
 * <p><br>
 * Alternatively, you may add gaps to the layout
 * without making additional changes to the scheme.
 * This approach requires specifying concrete sequential or parallel groups
 * and their concrete elements near which a gap should be added, for example:
 * <pre>
 * gle.getSequentialGroup(Axis.HORIZONTAL, ""CB11"", ""CB22"")
 *   .getGroup(""CB12"",""CB22"")
 *     .addPrecedingUnrelatedGap(GroupLayout.DEFAULT_SIZE,Short.MAX_VALUE);
 * </pre>
 * We do not recommend to use the letter approach because it minimizes
 * the advantages of the group layout engineer.
 *
 * <h3>How to draw schemes</h3>
 *
 * In order to avoid formal introduction to this topic,
 * we refer to the examples in the package {@code glengineer.demos}
 * for general introduction to the schemes.
 * <p>
 * Here we mention specific yet essential details only.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li> The names of components (and gaps) on the scheme may consist of
 * letters of any case, numbers, and underscores '_'.
 * <li> For each layout direction (horizontal and vertical)
 * the engineer tries to divide every non-trivial block of elements
 * on the scheme into a sequential or a parallel
 * (if the former is not possible) group of elements or subblocks.
 * <li> One may place on the scheme horizontal and vertical lines
 * which consist of symbols '-' and '|' respectively
 * (and optionally of symbols '+' for the intersections).
 * <li> If a block on the scheme is intersected by
 * a (horizontal or vertical) line, then this block will
 * not be divided into a sequential group of that direction.
 * Hence, it will be divided into a parallel group.
 * <li> The lines do not influence the layout in the perpendicular direction
 * (but, certainly, this layout direction is influenced
 * by the space under the line).
 * <li> If a block is divided into a parallel group by a number of lines,
 * it is divided only by those of them which have the maximum length,
 * and the smaller lines (if they exist) are left for the subblocks.
 * <li> Gaps on the scheme affect sequential groups only.
 * <li> If two sequential subblocks are divided by a number of gaps,
 * then these gaps will be replaced by a single gap of that type.
 * <li> Gaps on the scheme may lie AT lines.
 * Such lines are considered as being continued under that gaps,
 * and the gaps affect only the direction perpendicular to the
 * corresponding line.
 * <li> A line may be intersected only by one gap.
 * <li> If a gap touches one of the sides of a line,
 * it is also assumed that they intersect.
 * </ol>
